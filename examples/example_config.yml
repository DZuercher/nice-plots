# DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FILE OF NICE-PLOTS
##########################################

# This configuration file also servers as a template for a user-defined
# configuration file.


# The following attributes must be adapted for your project.
############################################################

# Name of the column in the codebook that contains the number identifying to
# which question block the question belongs.
# Questions with -1 are ignored in the plotting.
block_id_label : 'Gruppe Plots'

# Name of the column in the codebook that contains the question text.
question_label : 'Label'

# Name of the column in the codebook that contains the names of the variables.
# These names have to match the names of the variables in the data table!
name_label : 'Variable Name'

# Name of the column in the codebook that contains the mapping from
# code numbers in the data table to labels.
# The cells must contain multiple entries separated by newlines.
# Each entry must follow the format <code value> = <text label>.
# The first entry must have <code value> = 1, and subsequent entries count
# upwards from there.
# <code values> with 0 in the data table correspond to no answer
# and will not appear in the plots.
# If the codes should be used as labels directly write none instead
# of a mapping.

# Example cell entry:
# 1 = nie
# 2 = manchmal
# 3 = immer
mapping_label : 'Value Codes'

# Optional filter funcitons. Allows to split data into multiple categories
# based on the values of certain variables. The different categories are compared
# against each others in the plots.
filters : {'2. Klasse': 'var8 == 1', '3. Klasse': 'var8 == 2'}


# You might want to change some of the following attributes.
