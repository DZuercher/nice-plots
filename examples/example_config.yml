# EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE FOR NICE-PLOTS
###########################################

# This example config shows all the available options as well as their default values
# When writing your own config you do not need to specify all the options. For options that
# you do not use the default values are used.

data:
  # Name of the column in the codebook that contains the number identifying to
  # which question block the question belongs.
  # Questions with None are ignored when plotting.
  block_id_label: "Group"

  # Name of the column in the codebook that contains the question text.
  question_label: "Label"

  # Name of the column in the codebook that contains the names of the variables.
  # These names have to match the names of the variables in the data table!
  name_label: "Variable"

  # Name of the column in the codebook that contains the mapping from
  # code numbers in the data table to labels.
  # The cells must contain multiple entries separated by newlines.
  # Each entry must follow the format <code value> = <text label>.
  # If no mapping is provided (empty) the codes are used directly, separated into <nbins> linearly spaced bins

  # Example cell entry:
  # 1 = nie
  # 2 = manchmal
  # 3 = immer
  mapping_label: "Value Codes"

  # TODO: Define how these are treated
  # The name of the column in the codebook indicating the missing code
  # (question not filled out by participant).
  missing_label: "Missing Code"

  # Code used to identify participants that chose no answer
  no_answer_code: 999

  # Optional filter functions. Allows to split data into multiple categories
  # based on the values of certain variables. The different categories are compared
  # against each others in the plots.
  # The syntax is: {filter1, filter2, ...}
  # and each filter follows the format: 'group name' : 'varibale operator value'
  # NOTE: The whitespaces matter!
  # Example:
  groups:
    Group 1: "VAR02 == 1"
    Others: "(VAR02 == 2) | (VAR02 == 4)"

  # The delimiter in the codebook and data table (NOTE: Excel uses ; by default)
  delimiter: ","

plotting:
  # Total plot width (careful, changing this will change the aspect ratio!)
  plot_width: 8 # in inches

  # output format
  format: pdf

  # Number of bins used by default to create linear binning scheme.
  # Only used if mapping is none
  nbins: 5

  # Default unit used for legend if mapping is none
  unit: ""

# BARPLOTS OPTIONS
############################################################

#    For each question and group plot a horizontal bar. Each segment of the bar corresponds one answer and its width
#    represents the relative amount of people that chose this answer.
#
#    For each question a short statistics summary is added.
#
#    Y-Layout: The only physical size input for the vertical direction is the height of one question barplot unit
#    (height_question, in inches).
#
#
#    The physical height of the plot is calculated from the number of questions, groups,
#    relative spacings and the desired physical size of the bars.
#
#    For the legend at the top 2 * height_question is allocated.

#    X-Layout: For each component of the barplot (question label, group label, etc.) the physical width is
#    required as an input in inches. The total physical width is the sum of all components.
#
#    Text is wrapped automatically to the correct width.
#
#    Note: If the fontsize is very large and the text is very long it can happen that the wrapping does not
#    work properly (overlapping or many lines).
#    In that case you should increase the physical width of the plot components.
