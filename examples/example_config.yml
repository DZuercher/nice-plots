# EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE FOR NICE-PLOTS
###########################################

# This example config shows all the available options as well as their default values
# When writing your own config you do not need to specify all the options, but only those
# for which you wish to deviate from the default values.
# NOTE: If you wish to change the actual default values you need to change the values in utils/config.py

data:
  # Name of the column in the codebook that contains the number identifying to
  # which question block the question belongs.
  # Questions with None are ignored when plotting.
  block_id_label: "Group"

  # Name of the column in the codebook that contains the question text.
  question_label: "Label"

  # Name of the column in the codebook that contains the names of the variables.
  # These names have to match the names of the variables in the data table!
  name_label: "Variable"

  # Name of the column in the codebook that contains the mapping from
  # code numbers in the data table to labels.
  # The cells must contain multiple entries separated by newlines.
  # Each entry must follow the format <code value> = <text label>.
  # If no mapping is provided (empty) the codes are used directly, separated into <nbins> linearly spaced bins

  # Example cell entry:
  # 1 = nie
  # 2 = manchmal
  # 3 = immer
  mapping_label: "Value Codes"

  # The name of the column in the codebook indicating the missing code
  # (question not filled out by participant).
  # These data entries are completely ignored when plotting.
  missing_label: "Missing Code"

  # Code used to identify participants that chose no answer.
  # These data entries are not used when plotting but they show up in the summary stats
  # of some plotting types (e.g. barplots)
  no_answer_code: 999

  # Optional filter functions. Allows to split data into multiple groups
  # based on the values of certain variables. The different groups are compared
  # against each others in the plots.
  # Example:
  groups:
    Group 1: "VAR02 == 1"
    Others: "(VAR02 == 2) | (VAR02 == 4)"

  # The delimiter in the codebook and data table (NOTE: Excel uses ; by default)
  delimiter: ","

plotting:
  # output format
  format: pdf

  # Number of bins used by default to create linear binning scheme.
  # Only used if mapping is none
  nbins: 5

  # Default unit used for legend if mapping is none
  unit: ""

# BARPLOTS OPTIONS
############################################################
#    For each question and group plot a horizontal bar. Each segment of the bar corresponds one answer and its width
#    represents the relative amount of people that chose this answer.
#
#    For each question a short statistics summary is added.
#
#    Y-Layout: The only physical size input for the vertical direction is the height of one question barplot unit
#    (height_question, in inches).
#
#
#    The physical height of the plot is calculated from the number of questions, groups,
#    relative spacings and the desired physical size of the bars.
#
#    For the legend at the top 2 * height_question is allocated.

# LINEPLOTS OPTIONS
############################################################
#    For each question a linegrid is plotted. The mean of each group is indicated by a cross.
#
#    Y-Layout: The only physical size input for the vertical direction is the height of one question lineplot unit
#    (height_question, in inches). The spacing between questions is controlled by rel_edge_line_height.
#    Concretely, the parameter controls the height of the vertical bars
#    (1 = bars will just touch each other, 0= no vertical bars).
#
#    The physical height of the plot is calculated from the number of questions, groups,
#    relative spacings and the desired physical size of the bars.

# HISTOGRAM OPTIONS
############################################################
#    If a question block contains only a single question plot a bar in a histogram for each answer (per group).
#    If a question block contains multiple questions with 2 possible answers, interpret as binary (1=Yes, 0=No) and
#    plot a bar in a histogram for each question (per group).
#
#    A summary of the total number of participants that answered (n) and the number of participants that chose no answer (E)
#    is provided.
#
#    Y-Layout: The only physical size input for the vertical direction is the height of a single bar (height_bar, in inches).
#    Additionally, height_rel_pad_questions controls the relative spacing between group bar bundles
#
#    The physical height of the plot is calculated from the number of questions, groups,
#    relative spacings and the desired physical size of the bars.
